## [Unreleased]


### Added
Add new Python rule GCI82 - Make non reassigned variables constants
### Changed
Implement GCI82 rule for Python to detect variables that are never reassigned and can be converted to constants. 
The rule analyses assignment and compound assignment nodes to identify write-once variables and suggests using uppercase naming conventions to improve code clarity and reduce environmental footprint.
